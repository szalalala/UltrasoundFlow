# UltrasoundFlow
It's projekt for gas flow measurement with usage of ultrasound wave propagation time. It use 2 Input Capture Unit of 2 16-bit Timers/Couters on Input Capture Pin to rising edge of signal. Rising edge is from amplifire of piezoelectric membrane witch is reciving ultrasound wave from another piezoelectric memgrane witch is working as transmitter. Transmited signal come from cyclic interruption, wher signal is set to high for 25 ms (40hz).
## Getting Started
